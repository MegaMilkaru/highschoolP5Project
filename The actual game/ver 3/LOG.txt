+added currentScore as variable
+added highScore as variable
+added targets

todo list:
-add an actual arena so it cant float or spawn behind the UI ribbon
-fix the hit detection.


Reminder:
game needs
-radio buttons
=change game colour and aesthetics


CURRENT BUGS:
even if a hit is registered. the function still marks the other targets as "missed"
balls can spawn "hugging" the edge
game starts when the mouse clicks anywhere on the screen, rendering the actual game start button useless
