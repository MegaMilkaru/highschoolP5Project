+added the arena
+"fixed" the hit detection
+fixed the game starting without needing to press the start button

todo list:
-add the timer
-add radio buttons that change the A E S T H E T I C S
-add more to the level mechanic. so the balls actually get faster with every level

Reminder:
game needs
-radio buttons that change the A E S T H E T I C S


CURRENT BUGS:
even if a hit is registered. the function still marks the other targets as "missed" <-----(fixed by simply cutting it from the game entirely)
balls can spawn "hugging" the edge <----(fixed by making the spawning zone smaller)
game starts when the mouse clicks anywhere on the screen, rendering the actual game start button useless <----(FIXED!!! long story, took like 30 mins, not even kidding)
